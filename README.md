# NN-STD-O3

This is the repository for the manuscript "High-Energy Reaction Dynamics of $\mathrm{O}_{3}$" (submitted to the Journal of Chemical Physics).

+ The PES files are within the folder "O3-1AP-PES". 

+ The folder "STD-NN-RKHS" contains the scripts and data for constructing and evaluating the NN-STD model for the $`\mathrm{O}_3`$ RKHS PES. The folder "STD-NN-PIP" contains the scripts and data for constructing and evaluating the NN-STD model for the $\mathrm{O}_{3}$ PIP PES (Varga et al., J. Chem. Phys. 147, 154312 (2017)).

+ There is a brief note or manual inside each folder.
